Details: This python script isto be run on Raspberry pi. I am using an older Raspberry Pi 2 B+ and have a breaboard connected with a t-connector and 2 LEDs connected to it.

There will be additions to this project that will be added in time: 
- button to turn off the Pi
- ability to run a white nose maker that will (1) turn on when it is time to go to sleep and when the light is off and (2) turn off when it is OK to wake up and the light is on -This thread is a start: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=143896 

This is my first Python project and my first GIT repository!
I am almost certain that I have issues with the time logic, so please check it before you use it!
